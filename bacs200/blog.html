				<p>NFTs (non-fungible tokens) are digital assets that represent something special, whether it be a collectible item, 
					a piece of art, or even just a digital file. These tokens are changing how communities form, sustain and operate online.
					Now, through the use of blockchain technology and smart contracts, items can be stored and tracked on a secure public ledger,
					meaning they can never be destroyed or taken away from their owner. This opens up a whole new world for collectors and artists alike, 
					as it allows them to create and trade digital assets in a trustless and decentralized manner.
					And it's not just art that is being tokenized in this way.

					<h2>Social Implications</h2>
					<p> NFT's are creating a very postive impact on the online community. These tokens have created a way for 
					people to follow and involve themselves in projects that they like. It also also people to start their own projects 
					very easily. People have been seen making millions off of these digital art projects, not eveyone will be millions however. 
					A common mistake around NFT's is that people who do not do their reseach or understand this new community will take a huge
					finnacial loss. This will also cause for "hate" from critics who do not agree with this newform of crypto currency.
