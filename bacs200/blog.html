				<p>NFTs (non-fungible tokens) are digital assets that represent something special, whether it be a collectible item, 
					a piece of art, or even just a digital file. These tokens are changing how communities form, sustain and operate online.
					Now, through the use of blockchain technology and smart contracts, items can be stored and tracked on a secure public ledger,
					meaning they can never be destroyed or taken away from their owner. This opens up a whole new world for collectors and artists alike, 
					as it allows them to create and trade digital assets in a trustless and decentralized manner.
					And it's not just art that is being tokenized in this way. </p>

					<h2>Social Implications</h2>
					<p> NFT's are creating a very postive impact on the online community. These tokens have created a way for 
					people to follow and involve themselves in projects that they like. It also also people to start their own projects 
					very easily. People have been seen making millions off of these digital art projects, not eveyone will be millions however. 
					A common mistake around NFT's is that people who do not do their reseach or understand this new community will take a huge
					finnacial loss. This will also cause for "hate" from critics who do not agree with this newform of crypto currency.</p>

					<h2>Economical Implications</h2>
					<p> For the year of 2020 people will more commonly know the economic pain caused by COVID-19 but also in this same year people 
					started being much more creative with technoogy and its relationship with the economy. These NFT's or 
					unquie blockchain-based digital assests have created a different type of store value while undersdtadning digital transactions. 
					Beyond the implications for consumers and investors, NFTs are set to disrupt our notions of copyright and ownership. 
					Because transactions are permanently tracked on a digital ledger, it’s possible to know who made the purchase, 
					when it took place and how much the buyer spent. NFTs are a major economic innovation because they allow creatives 
					anywhere in the world to share and receive payment for their work. This will likely incentivize the development of more NFTs,
					which consumers everywhere have demonstrated that they’re more than willing to purchase. This holds the same weight as before that
					some people will be serveyly negatively impacted if they do not put the time into better understand these block chains. </p>

					<h2>Political Implications</h2>
					<p> NFT's are being embraced by polatics and they are now starting to use these block-chains as a way to influence and fund political campaigns.
					"NFTs are bringing more people into our fold, into our movement," said Max Rymer, a digital consultant for Minnesota Republican gubernatorial candidate Dr. Scott Jensen.
					people will be able to hold some sort of value for there favortie canidites and allow a reccuring postive feedback loop. This has already been seen being used for the
					upcoming elections where a group of artist are selling old 80's and 90's magazine covers as a NFT so that way they can jumpstart a funding for their candidate. There 
					is not enough evdience to show any sort of good or bad implication yet. This still holds the same weight as before that some people will be serveyly negatively impacted 
					if they do not put the time into better understand these block chains.

					<h2>Conclusion</h2>
					<p> NFT's are not all bad but not all goof eithier there are lots of pros and cons with the growth of this new form of investments.
						People really need to do their research before they start  getting involved with NFT's. This will help mitigate risk and 
						allow people to have mroe knowledge when they do go to get involved with these tokens. 
						<ul> Pros
							
						<li>NFTs provide a record of authenticity and ownership held and verifiable on the blockchain.
						<li>They’ve fashioned a new market to create wealth, with high growth potential.
						<li>NFTs generate efficiency with (smart) contracts by streamlining processes and eliminating intermediaries.
						<li>They empower a new marketplace for artists, allowing them to sell directly to collectors and receive royalties whenever the art is resold.
						<li>NFTs can potentially add diversification to your financial portfolio, as the economy and companies prepare for what’s next in a post-pandemic world. (That’s of course, only if you have the risk tolerance and liquid cash to invest at all.)
						<li>Some NFTs give you real-world perks such as access to high-end events, groups or associations depending on who the creators are.</li>
					</ul>
					<ul> Cons
						
						<li>NFTs are illiquid and speculative investments. Since it is a new asset and marketplace, there is not a lot of historical data to research.
						<li>It is a very volatile investment. As with most art, digital or physical, the value of it is relative and based on what someone is willing to pay for it. That’s the “unique” nature of a NFT, 
						which can be viewed as both a pro or a con.
						<li>They are not great for the environment. Over time, the effects of producing NFTs, or all types of cryptocurrency, can have a tremendous negative 
						long-term effect on our environment.
						<li>There is a potential for fraud and scammers within the space. Despite the blockchain, NFTs are currently able to be hacked and stolen,
						which adds another big risk to consider.
					</ul>
