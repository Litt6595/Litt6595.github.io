  <p style="text-align: center; font-size: 20px"> A first responder is a person with specialized training who is among the first to arrive and provide assistance at the scene of an emergency, such as an accident, 
    natural disaster, or terrorism. First responders typically include law enforcement officers, paramedics, EMT's (emergency medical technicians) and firefighters. 
    In some areas, emergency department personnel,  such as nurses and doctors, are also required to respond to disasters and critical situations, 
    designating them first responders. </p>

    <p style="text-align: center; font-size: 20px"> First responders have been heros in our country in the last few years especially during the COVID-19 pandemic. These individuals work very hard to meet the needs
      of others in need. This can be a common check up at the doctor, a severe medical surgurey, mental health or even as bad as a tramatic car accident. These heros 
      sacrifise their life, familys, time & energy, and their physical and mental health in order to extend a helping hand. There is a riseing problem around this 
      and it has to do with the low wages and terrible treatment. For being heros and the first to respond to cries for help they do not get paid very well and they do not
      get the proper care they deserve. </p>
