  <h2>Videos</h2>
      <p> Youtube or tiktok are great places to find really silly videos like monkeys smiling. 
        Here is a link to a video of a monkey <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mtkcFLSPvns">smiling</a>
        I bet this video made you smirk at the very least. </p>
  <h2>Research</h2>
      <p> There is lots of research that explains why smiles are so amusing to humans. an article I found by the Scientific American that explains
        the social behavior behind smiles. Sometimes smiles with teeth in the primate world is a threat or sign of violence. This is also the same 
        in human babies, they find discomort in very teeth baring smiles. This has evolved exponetitally to what it is today. we see smiles as a 
        nice or kind gesture and is often used when laughing and expressing happiness. I belive that seeing an monkey or another human smile will 
        boost your mood and mkae you smile as well. </p>
